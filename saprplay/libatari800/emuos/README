This folder contains the sources for the Altirra ROM replacements, used
to build the internal emulator OS and BASIC.

To rebuild the files, you need the MAD assembler in your path, download from
here: https://github.com/tebe6502/Mad-Assembler/releases

Just type make in this directory and the C files will be built.

To update Altirra ROMs, copy the following files into the following
locations:

src/Kernel/source/main.xasm -> main.xasm
src/Kernel/source/Shared/* -> src/
src/Kernel/source/SuperKernel/* -> src_5200/
src/ATBasic/source/* -> src_basic/

If new files were added, you may need to edit the Makefile.
