Provide some way of using fadestart/fadelen info from those files that
provide it. (Does currently read the info, but it's ignored.)


Really want runtime modification/loading/saving of playlist in at
least the GTK+ version. It's a bit of a pain though, so it might be a
while in coming.


The silent-time-count isn't reset for new tracks. Rarely noticeable,
but if you jump from one currently-silent track to another which
remains silent, it'll skip the new track after less time than usual.


The button bitmaps in xaylet are hardcoded to use black. This is bound
to cause problems with dark GTK+ themes. Should see if there's some
way I can get them to use the button-text colour.
